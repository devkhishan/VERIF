        <br><p class="subhead"><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p><br>
<p>These days it is important to verify a person&rsquo;s identity before letting them do anything in public.</p>
<p>And in countries like India the most widely used method of verification of a person&rsquo;s identity is &ldquo;Aadhar card&rdquo; which has every bit of your information from name to address, which is very crucial information, when it ends up in the wrong person&apos;s hand could be a disaster.</p>
<br><p class="subhead"><strong>PROBLEM</strong></p><br>
<p>We are sometimes even asked to give a copy of our aadhar card to non-government organizations to prove our identity which is a big danger.</p><br>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>Privacy&nbsp;of the user is affected (by giving his info on aadhar card to a third person)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>This information could be&nbsp;misused&nbsp;by others</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Also, the&nbsp;centralization of data&nbsp;will be a problem if there are any compromises in security of those data.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>There are even chances of creating fake aadhar cards.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>It is very hard to find the difference&nbsp;between fake and real&nbsp;aadhar cards to an untrained person.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Tracking back is&nbsp;impossible if fake information is given.</p>
    </li>
</ul><br>
<p class="subhead"><strong>SOLUTION</strong></p><br>
<p>The only reason for services to ask for ID verification is to make sure that their service doesn&apos;t end up in the wrong hands.</p>
<p>Also, to track back if found so.</p>
<p>So, here comes our VERIF card.</p><br>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>Users&rsquo; privacy will be protected as he/she is&nbsp;not required to provide any information&nbsp;about him/her.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>There is no misuse of information as no data is given to those service providers.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>The&nbsp;decentralized&nbsp;server has no security compromises.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>There is&nbsp;no chance of creating fakes&nbsp;as data provided is compared with data in the servers.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Service providers will get a message of&nbsp;authentication&nbsp;from the government servers.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Tracking back is easy as the information of use of the card is also stored.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<br><p class="subhead"><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p><br>
<p>Despite the fact that it is a large-scale project,we think it will be most effective and user friendly in all aspects and help both users/citizens and the government in the smooth functioning.</p><br><br><br>
